Measure distance on drivetrain - ensure that 1m = 1m

Check drivetrain PIDs
	- rotation PID
		- at small angle (10, 20 deg)
		- at large angle (150 deg)
	- drivestraight PID
		- high speed
		- low speed

Do vision calibration
	- Measure at 3 distances FROM CAMERA (on batter (~1.45m), 2.75m, on outerworks (~3.85m)
		- get CenterX, CenterY, and ideally hood height if possible
		- create quadratic of (centerY, distance), plug in a, b, c
		- create line of (distance, centerX), plug in m, b
		- create quadratic of (distance, hoodheight), plug in a, b ,c
	- See if autotarget is consistently scoring

Get new encoder values for intake at ground, intake at ball height

Get new encoder values for max rotation of turret

Make sure autointake works, ball sensor in correct place
